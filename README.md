# Mechanical-Signature-of-Red-Blood-Cells
Red blood cells (RBCs) have a special ability to undergo cellular deformation to travel through different human microcirculation arteries, allowing them to perform their function as gas carriers between blood and tissues by passing through capillaries with a diameter smaller than their own.
Many illnesses, including malaria, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, genetic disorders, myocardial infarction, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, have been linked to pathological changes in RBC deformability (PNH).
Measurement of RBC deformability has been the subject of various investigations over the years due to its pathophysiological significance. 
Here, codes are related to the mathematical modeling of the cytoskeleton and morphology of red blood cells (RBCs) under linear tension.
## Virtual Cell Model

The Virtual Cell Model (VCM) software package is a Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation software. The core concept of VCM is to get particle coordinates and the potentials between them and solve Newton's equations to calculate the dynamics of the system.
