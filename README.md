Mechanical properties and iscoelasticity of the human red blood cell
Red blood cells (RBCs) have a special ability to undergo cellular deformation to travel through different human microcirculation arteries, allowing them to perform their function as gas carriers between blood and tissues by passing through capillaries with a diameter smaller than their own.
Many illnesses, including malaria, sickle cell anemia, diabetes, genetic disorders, myocardial infarction, and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, have been linked to pathological changes in RBC deformability (PNH).
Measurement of RBC deformability has been the subject of various investigations over the years due to its pathophysiological significance. 
Here, codes are related to the mathematical modeling of the cytoskeleton and morphology of red blood cells (RBCs) under linear tension.
